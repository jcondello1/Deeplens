Place DLPersonCounter folder on client PC.  Run DLPersonCounter.exe from Bin folder.
The report is hosted here (http://ec2-34-212-20-135.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/), or you can setup a webserver and host the code I provided in the DLReport folder. 
I'm not entirely sure how you are going to test all these moving parts.  Please let me know if I can supply anything additional to help out.
